title: "Ethnic Proximity and Politics: Evidence from Colonial Resettlement in Malaysia"
category: articles
permalink: /articles/2024
excerpt: "During the Malayan Emergency (from 1948 through 1960), the colonial British implemented a large-scale colonial resettlement program targeting 500,000 rural ethnic Chinese villagers in ethnic Malay-majority Malaysia. In a fight for “hearts and minds”, Chinese villagers were relocated into fenced-up, isolated, mono-ethnic camps (Chinese New Villages) to cut-off support to the Malayan Communist Party. Using granular electoral data at the polling-district level and a spatial randomization inference approach, we show that polling districts that were close to the Chinese New Villages had lower ethno-nationalistic vote shares in 2013, than polling districts that were close to nearby counterfactual locations that would have been similarly suitable for these villages. The results are not driven by turnout rates. We provide evidence that the lower ethno-nationalistic vote shares were unlikely to be confined to the ethnic Chinese electorate. Taken together, our results suggest that differences in inter-ethnic proximity shape voter preferences for ethnic politics."
