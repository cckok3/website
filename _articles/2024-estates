title: "Planting Seeds of Knowledge? Rubber Estates and Human Capital Investment in British Malaya"
category: articles
permalink: /articles/2024
excerpt: "What are the long-run effects of globalization on investment in human capital? Using the locations of rubber estates in the early 20th century British Malaya, I exploit exogenous variation in estates' optimal location - proximity to the nearest railway station interacted with rubber-specific agroclimatic suitability - to identify the effects of proximity to the historical rubber estates on subsequent educational attainments. I find that, on average, proximity to historical rubber estates increases subsequent educational attainments, and the effects are driven by the young cohort, but not the older cohort. The education-improving effects can be explained by the sectoral shift and increased income, but not access to schools and selective migration. "
