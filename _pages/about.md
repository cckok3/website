I'm a Ph.D Candidate at the [Department of Economics](https://www.monash.edu/business/economics) from Monash University, Australia where my supervisors are [Sascha O. Becker](http://www.sobecker.de/) and [Paul Raschky](https://praschky.github.io/). I am visiting the [Quantitative Political Economy (QPE) research group](https://sites.google.com/view/kingsqpe/home) at King's College London and the [Department of Economics](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/) at the University of Warwick in 2024. 

I am an applied microeconomist interested in **economic history, political economy, development economics, and economic geography**. My thesis investigates how a large-scale colonial resettlement policy shaped voting patterns, interracial relations, and national identity during the mid-20th British Malaya (today's Malaysia). I often undertake extensive novel data collection efforts for which I make use of **geocomputation** and occasionally **LLM**.
